 i'm lightning on my feet 
 and that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm 
 that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm

 i make the moves up as i go (moves up as i go) 
 and that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm 
 that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm 
  
 but i keep cruising 
 can't stop, won't stop grooving 
 it's like i got this music 
 in my mind 
 saying, it's gonna be alright. 
  
 'cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play 
 and the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate 
 baby, i'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake 
 i shake it off, i shake it off 
 heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break 
 and the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake 
 baby, i'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake 
 i shake it off, i shake it off
