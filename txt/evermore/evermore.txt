 gray november 
 i've been down since july 
 motion capture 
 put me in a bad light 
  
 i replay my footsteps on each stepping stone 
 trying to find the one where i went wrong 
 writing letters 
 addressed to the fire 
  
 and i was catching my breath 
 staring out an open window 
 catching my death 
 and i couldn't be sure 
 i had a feeling so peculiar 
 that this pain would be for 
 evermore 
  
 hey december 
 guess i'm feeling unmoored 
 can't remember 
 what i used to fight for 
  
 i rewind the tape but all it does is pause 
 on the very moment all was lost 
 sending signals 
 to be double-crossed

 and i was catching my breath 
 barefoot in the wildest winter 
 catching my death 
 and i couldn't be sure 
 i had a feeling so peculiar 
 that this pain would be for 
 evermore 
 (evermore) 
  
 <i>[justin vernon:]</i> 
 can't not think of all the cost 
 and the things that will be lost 
 oh, can we just get a pause? 
 to be certain we'll be tall again 
 whether weather be the frost 
 or the violence of the dog days 
 i'm on waves, out being tossed 
 is there a line that i could just go cross? 
  
 <i>[taylor swift and justin vernon:]</i> 
 and when i was shipwrecked (can't think of all the cost) 
 i thought of you (all the things that will be lost now) 
 in the cracks of light (can we just get a pause?) 
 i dreamed of you (to be certain we'll be tall again) 
 (if you think of all the costs) 
 it was real enough (whether weather be the frost) 
 to get me through (or the violence of the dog days) 
 (or the violence of the dog days) 
 (out on waves, being tossed) 
 (i'm on waves, out being tossed) 
 i swear (is there a line that we could just go cross?) 
 you were there 
  
 and i was catching my breath 
 floors of a cabin creaking under my step 
 and i couldn't be sure 
 i had a feeling so peculiar 
 this pain wouldn't be for 
 evermore 
 evermore 
 evermore 
 this pain wouldn't be for evermore 
 evermore
