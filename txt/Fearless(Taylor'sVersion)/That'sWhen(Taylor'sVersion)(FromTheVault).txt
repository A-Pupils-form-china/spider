 you said, i know 
 when i said, i need some time, need some space 
 to think about all of this 
 you watched me go 
 and i knew my 
 words were hard to hear 
 and harder to ever take back 
 and i said, when can i-i-i come back? 
  
 <i>[taylor swift and keith urban:]</i> 
 and you said that's when 
 when i wake up in the morning 
 that's when, when it's sunny or storming 
 laughing, when i'm crying 
 and that's when, i'll be waiting at the front gate 
 that's when, when i see your face 
 i'll let you in, and baby, that's when 
 mm, mm 
  
 i said, i know 
 when you said, i did you wrong 
 made mistakes 
 and put you through all of this (through all of this) 
 then through the phone 
 came all your tears 
 and i said, leave those all in our past 
 and you said, when can i-i-i come back? 
  
 and i said, that's when 
 when i wake up in the morning 
 that's when, when it's sunny or storming 
 laughing, when i'm crying 
 and that's when i'll be waiting at the front gate 
 that's when, when i see your face 
 i'll let you in, and baby, that's when 
  
 <i>[taylor swift:]</i> 
 and you said, honestly 
 when you were gone 
 did you ever think of me? 
 and i said 
  
 <i>[taylor swift with keith urban:]</i> 
 that's when, when i woke up in the morning 
 that's when, it was sunny or storming 
 laughing when i was crying 
 and that's when, you were waiting at the front gate 
 that's when, when i saw your face 
 you let me in, and baby, that's when 
  
 that's when, when i wake up in the morning (yeah) 
 that's when, when it's sunny or storming 
 when i'm laughing, when i'm crying 
 that's when i'll be waiting at the front gate 
 (that when i miss you, that's when i want you) 
 that's when, when i see your face 
 that's when i love you, that's when
