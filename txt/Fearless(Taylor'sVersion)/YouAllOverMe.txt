 once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement 
 shouldn't i find a stain, but i never do 
 the way the tires turn stones, on old county roads 
 they leave 'em muddy underneath 
 reminds me of you 
 you find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls 
 you know, you can scratch it right off 
 it's how it used to be 
 but like the dollar in your pocket it's been spent and traded in 
 you can't change where it's been 
 reminds me of me

 i lived, and i learned 
 had you, got burned 
 held out, and held on 
 god knows, too long 
 and wasted time, lost tears 
 swore that i'd get out of here 
 but no amount of freedom gets you clean 
 i've still got you all over me 
  
 the best and worst day of june 
 was the one that i met you 
 with your hands in your pockets 
 and your don't you wish you had me? grin 
 well, i did, so i smiled, and i melted like a child 
 now every breath of air i breathe reminds me of then 
  
 and i lived, and i learned 
 had you, got burned 
 held out, and held on 
 god knows, too long 
 and wasted time, lost tears 
 swore that i'd get out of here 
 but no amount of freedom gets you clean 
 i've still got you all over me 
  
 i lived, and i learned 
 and found out what it was to turn around 
 and see, that we 
 were never really meant to be 
 so i lied, and i cried 
 and i watched a part of myself die 
 'cause no amount of freedom gets you clean 
 i've still got you all over me 
 i've still got you all over me 
 still got you all over me
