  
 hey, i knew i'd run into you somewhere 
 it's been a while, i didn't mean to stare 
 i heard she's nothin' like me 
 i'm sure she'll make you happy 
  
 but don't you 
 don't you smile at me and ask me how i've been 
 don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again 
 you don't know how much i feel i love you still 
 so why don't you, don't you? 
  
 ah, ah, ah, ah 
  
 sometimes i really wish that i could hate you 
 i've tried, but that's just somethin' i can't do 
 my heart knows what the truth is 
 i swore i wouldn't do this 
  
 but don't you 
 don't you smile at me and ask me how i've been 
 don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again 
 you don't know how much i feel i love you still 
 so why don't you, don't you? 
  
 so i walk outta here tonight 
 try to go on with my life 
 and you can say, we're still friends 
 i don't wanna pretend 
 so if i see you again 
  
 don't you (don't you) 
 don't you smile at me and ask me how i've been 
 don't you (don't you), say you've missed me if you don't want me again 
 you don't (you don't), know how much i feel i love you still 
 so why don't you, don't you? 
  
 ah, ah, ah, ah 
 don't you, ah, ah, ah
