  
 my winter nights are taken up by static 
 stress, and holiday shopping traffic 
 but i close my eyes, and i'm somewhere else 
 just like magic 
  
 in my heart is a christmas tree farm 
 where the people would come 
 to dance under sparkling lights 
 bundled up in their mittens and coats 
 and the cider would flow 
 and i just wanna be there tonight 
  
 sweet dreams of holly and ribbon 
 mistakes are forgiven 
 and everything is icy and blue 
 and you would be there too 
  
 under the mistletoe 
 watching the fire glow 
 and telling me, i love you 
 just being in your arms 
 takes me back to that little farm 
 where every wish comes true 
  
 in my heart is a christmas tree farm 
 there's a light in the barn 
 we'd run inside out from the cold 
 in the town, kids are dreaming of sleighs 
 and they're warm and they're safe 
 they wake to see a blanket of snow 
  
 sweet dreams of holly and ribbon 
 mistakes are forgiven 
 and everything is icy and blue 
 and you would be there too 
  
 under the mistletoe 
 watching the fire glow 
 and telling me, i love you 
 just being in your arms 
 takes me back to that little farm 
 where every wish comes true 
 (baby, yeah!) 
  
 and when i'm feeling alone 
 you remind me of home 
 oh baby, baby, merry christmas 
 and when the world isn't fair 
 i'll pretend that we're there 
 baby, baby, merry christmas 
 to you 
  
 under the mistletoe (to you) 
 watching the fire glow 
 and telling me, i love you 
  
 baby, baby, merry christmas 
 oh baby, baby, merry christmas 
 (darling) 
 baby, baby, merry christmas 
 i love you 
  
 oh baby, baby, merry christmas 
 oh baby, baby, merry christmas 
 (i just want you to know) 
 oh baby, baby, merry christmas 
 may your every wish come true
