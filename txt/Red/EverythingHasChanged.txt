 you good to go? 
  
 <i>[taylor swift:]</i> 
 all i knew this morning when i woke 
 is i know something now, know something now i didn't before 
 and all i've seen since eighteen hours ago 
 is green eyes and freckles and your smile 
 in the back of my mind making me feel like 
  
 i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now 
 i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now 
  
 <i>[both:]</i> 
 i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now 
 i just wanna know you, know you, know you 
  
 'cause all i know is we said, hello 
 and your eyes look like coming home 
 all i know is a simple name 
 everything has changed 
 all i know is you held the door 
 you'll be mine and i'll be yours 
 all i know since yesterday is everything has changed 
  
 <i>[ed sheeran:]</i> 
 and all my walls stood tall painted blue 
 and i'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you 
  
 <i>[taylor swift:]</i> 
 and all i feel in my stomach is butterflies 
 the beautiful kind, making up for lost time 
 taking flight, making me feel right 
  
 <i>[both:]</i> 
 i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now 
 i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now 
 i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now 
 i just wanna know you, know you, know you 
  
 'cause all i know is we said, hello 
 and your eyes look like coming home 
 all i know is a simple name 
 everything has changed 
 all i know is you held the door 
 and you'll be mine and i'll be yours 
 all i know since yesterday is everything has changed 
  
 come back and tell me why 
 i'm feeling like i've missed you all this time 
 oh, oh, oh 
 and meet me there tonight 
 and let me know that it's not all in my mind 
  
 <i>[taylor swift:]</i> 
 i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now 
 i just wanna know you, know you, know you 
  
 <i>[both:]</i> 
 all i know is we said, hello 
 and your eyes look like coming home 
 all i know is a simple name 
 everything has changed 
 all i know is you held the door 
 you'll be mine and i'll be yours 
 all i know since yesterday is everything has changed 
  
 <i>[taylor swift:]</i> 
 all i know is we said, hello 
 so dust off your highest hopes 
 all i know is pouring rain and everything has changed 
 all i know is a new found grace 
 all my days i'll know your face 
 all i know since yesterday is everything has changed
