  
 it feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters 
 and make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh 
 it feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight 
 to fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh 
  
 yeah 
 we're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time 
 it's miserable and magical 
 oh, yeah 
 tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines 
 it's time 
  
 uh oh! 
 i don't know about you 
 but i'm feeling 22 
 everything will be alright 
 if you keep me next to you 
 you don't know about me 
 but i'll bet you want to 
 everything will be alright 
 if we just keep dancing like we're 
 22, ooh-ooh 
 22, ooh-ooh 
  
 it seems like one of those nights 
 this place is too crowded 
 too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's taylor swift anyway, ew?) 
 it seems like one of those nights 
 we ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming 
 instead of sleeping 
  
 yeah 
 we're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way 
 it's miserable and magical 
 oh, yeah 
 tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks 
 it's time 
  
 uh oh! (hey!) 
 i don't know about you 
 but i'm feeling 22 
 everything will be alright 
 if you keep me next to you 
 you don't know about me 
 but i'll bet you want to 
 everything will be alright (alright) 
 if we just keep dancing like we're 
 22, ooh-ooh (oh, oh, oh) 
 22, ooh-ooh 
 i don't know about you 
 22, ooh-ooh 
 22, ooh-ooh 
  
 it feels like one of those nights 
 we ditch the whole scene 
 it feels like one of those nights 
 we won't be sleeping 
 it feels like one of those nights 
 you look like bad news 
 i gotta have you 
 i gotta have you 
  
 ooh-ooh 
 ooh-ooh, ye-e-e-e-eah, hey 
 i don't know about you (i don't know about you) 
 but i'm feeling 22 
 everything will be alright 
 if you keep me next to you 
 you don't know about me (you don't know about me) 
 but i'll bet you want to 
 everything will be alright 
 if we just keep dancing like we're 
 22, ooh-ooh (oh â€“ whoa) 
 22, ooh-ooh (dancing like) 
 22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah 
 22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah 
  
 it feels like one of those nights 
 we ditch the whole scene 
 it feels like one of those nights 
 we won't be sleeping 
 it feels like one of those nights 
 you look like bad news 
 i gotta have you 
 i gotta have you
