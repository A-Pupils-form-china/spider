 knew her when i was young, reconnected when we were little bit older 
 both sprung, i got issues and chips on both of my shoulders 
 reputation precedes me, in rumors, i'm knee-deep 
 the truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me 
 even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long 
 and you understand the good and bad end up in the song 
 for all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease 
 for all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities 
 i've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny 
 after the storm, something was born on the 4th of july 
 i've passed days without fun, this end game is the one 
 with four words on the tip of my tongue, i'll never say it

 <i>[taylor swift:]</i> 
 i hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't 
 and i bury hatchets, but i keep maps of where i put 'em 
 reputation precedes me, they told you i'm crazy 
 i swear i don't love the drama, it loves me 
 and i can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul 
 it's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold 
 you've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks 
 so here's the truth from my red lips 
  
 <i>[swift, future, and ed sheeran:]</i> 
 i wanna be your end game (end game) 
 i wanna be your first string (me and you, first string) 
 i wanna be your a-team (be your a-team now, a-team) 
 i wanna be your end game, end game 
 i wanna be your end game (oh, i do) 
 i wanna be your first string (first string) 
 i wanna be your a-team (a-team) 
 i wanna be your end game, end game
