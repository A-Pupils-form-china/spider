  
 gorgeous 
  
 you should take it as a compliment 
 that i got drunk and made fun of the way you talk 
 you should think about the consequence 
 of your magnetic field being a little too strong 
 and i got a boyfriend, he's older than us 
 he's in the club doing, i don't know what 
 you're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (i hate you so much) 
  
 whisky on ice, sunset and vine 
 you've ruined my life by not being mine 
  
 you're so gorgeous 
 i can't say anything to your face 
 'cause look at your face (gorgeous) 
 and i'm so furious 
 at you for making me feel this way 
 but what can i say? 
 you're gorgeous 
  
 you should take it as a compliment 
 that i'm talking to everyone here but you (but you, but you) 
 and you should think about the consequence 
 of you touching my hand in a darkened room (dark room, dark room) 
 if you got a girlfriend, i'm jealous of her 
 but if you're single that's honestly worse 
 'cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts 
 (honey, it hurts) 
  
 ocean blue eyes looking in mine 
 i feel like i might sink and drown and die 
  
 you're so gorgeous 
 i can't say anything to your face (to your face) 
 'cause look at your face (look at your face, gorgeous) 
 and i'm so furious 
 at you for making me feel this way (feel this way) 
 but what can i say? 
 you're gorgeous 
  
 you make me so happy it turns back to sad 
 there's nothing i hate more than what i can't have 
 and you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (mmh) 
 you make me so happy it turns back to sad (yeah) 
 there's nothing i hate more than what i can't have and 
 guess i'll just stumble on home to my cats (yeugh), alone 
 unless, you wanna come along? (oh) 
  
 you're so gorgeous 
 i can't say anything to your face (to your face) 
 'cause look at your face (look at your face, gorgeous) 
 and i'm so furious (i'm so furious)

 but what can i say? (i say)
