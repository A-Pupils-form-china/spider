 i promise that you'll never find another like me 
  
 i know that i'm a handful baby, uh 
 i know i never think before i jump 
 and you're the kind of guy the ladies want 
 (and there's a lot of cool chicks out there) 
  
 i know that i went psycho on the phone 
 i never leave well enough alone 
 and trouble's gonna follow where i go 
 (and there's a lot of cool chicks out there) 
  
 but one of these things is not like the others 
 like a rainbow with all of the colors 
 baby doll, when it comes to a lover 
 i promise that you'll never find another like me-e-e-eh

 i know i tend to make it about me 
 i know you never get just what you see 
 but i will never bore you, baby

 and when we had that fight out in the rain 
 you ran after me and called my name 
 i never wanna see you walk away 
 (and there's a lot of lame guys out there) 
  
 'cause one of these things is not like the others 
 living in winter, i am your summer 
 baby doll, when it comes to a lover 
 i promise that you'll never find another like me-e-e-eh
